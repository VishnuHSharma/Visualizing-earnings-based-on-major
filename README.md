# Visualizing-earnings-based-on-major
This project utilizes  data set that was released by the American Community Survey and cleaned by Fivethirtyeight and released on their github repo. It contains information about college students and majors and reporting earnings. This project is a part of the dataquest data scientist path, but I extended it to do my own analysis.
